# Matlab utility codes

This is a collection of matlab functions and examples ("primers") I wrote through graduate school. 

Also see my [matlab community profile](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/5555147-wei-ting-lin).

## mfiles 
Codes as m-files are stored in folder **mfiles**.

Catalog of m-files can be found [here](https://github.com/weitingwlin/matlabutility/tree/master/documents), as well as the documentations.
#### Catelog

##### [Catalog of plotting functions](https://github.com/weitingwlin/matlabutility/blob/master/documents/catalog_myplot.md)
##### [Catalog of statistic utility](https://github.com/weitingwlin/matlabutility/blob/master/documents/catalog_stat.md)
##### [Catalog of ecological utility](https://github.com/weitingwlin/matlabutility/blob/master/documents/catalog_ecology.md)

#### Setup
* **work_setup.m** : this m-file set working directory to this mfiles folder. Can be a template for working with multiple machines.

## Xamples
**Xamples** provide example of usage in m-files for some of mine and Matlab functions

## workzone
**workzone** is a temporary stroage for under-construction files.

## documents
Folder **documents** contains detailed documents for some functions.
