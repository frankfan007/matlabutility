% Calculate numeric interaction between two  species
%
% Numeric interaction : the correlation between "the mean population of spp1" and "the change of population ofspp2" at each time interval. 
% dependent: [nancorr.m], [mv_avrg.m]
% 
% MatA, MatB : population matrix of species A and B. Each has size n x p, population of patch 1~n in time 1~p, each row is
%                     a time-series for a patch, each column is a snapshot
%                     of the community.
% screening :  vector of two elements, default is [0,0], do not filter out data with any zeros. 
%                    First element dictates whether to ignore  double zeros in the "cause" side (X in the correlation). 
%                    Second element dictates whether to ignore double zeros on the "effect" side (Y in the correlation). 
% ploton : show the plots of correlation between the moving average and the difference. 
%
% note 2016/02/19: add ploton option
